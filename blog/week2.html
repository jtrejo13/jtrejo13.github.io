  <h1>Week 2</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>This is week two of object-oriented programming. So far, the main focus of the class has been the introduction of tools and C++ syntax to tackle the first of five projects: Collatz.</p>

    <p>Collatz is a Mathematical conjecture also know as the 3n + 1 conjecture. Although (apparently) simple on the surface, no one has yet been able to prove that the sequence converges to 1 for every conceivable value <i>n</i>. The project consists of implementing a cycle length calculator in C++ that, when optimized, passes all three of HackerRank's online tests.</p>

    <p>Via this 'simple' problem, Dr. Downing has introduced the class to useful software development tools and methodologies that are relevant in industry. Among these are 'unit testing' and coverage - both of which lead to robust and bug free code.</p>
